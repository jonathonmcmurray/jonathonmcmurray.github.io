I am a software developer working at [AquaQ Analytics](https://www.aquaq.co.uk),
specialising in kdb+/q. This site contains (or will contain...it's a work in 
progress!) documentation on a number of q packages/libraries I develop, as well 
as some general musings on interesting kdb+ related topics.

You can find my projects at GitHub:

I work for [AquaQ Analytics](https://www.aquaq.co.uk), and occasionally write
posts on the [blog](https://www.aquaq.co.uk/blog). A few you may find
